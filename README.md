# vibe-cloud-project

## Project Description
We are building an application that lets users explore the vibes of restaurants in their zip code by presenting a word cloud of restaurant reviews. 
Our application will use two APIs to generate a word cloud. The first API will return a list of restaurants in a zip code provided by the user, as well reviews of those restaurants. The second API will generate a word cloud from the text of the reviews.

## User Story
As a person with an interest in dining in my area
I want to find a restaurant whose vibe and cuisine suit my interests
So that I can decide if I would like to go.
